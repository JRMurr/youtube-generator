What do they MEAN?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:49.140\" end=\"00:02:54.480\" style=\"s2\">H3h3 and PewDiePie amplified this issue<br />on Twitter and with a video,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:54.480\" end=\"00:02:57.460\" style=\"s2\">and other creators started<br />to make videos about this,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:57.460\" end=\"00:03:00.640\" style=\"s2\">and YouTube had to deal with it.<br />It became a PR crisis.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:00.640\" end=\"00:03:03.560\" style=\"s2\">Unlike some of their recent<br />Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s-style responses,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:03.560\" end=\"00:03:05.900\" style=\"s2\">they responded \\xe2\\x80\\x94 very tactfully.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:05.900\" end=\"00:03:07.600\" style=\"s2\">Like an experienced politician,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:07.600\" end=\"00:03:10.880\" style=\"s2\">they answered the question<br />that they wish they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been asked,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:10.880\" end=\"00:03:14.280\" style=\"s2\">and not exactly the question<br />that was raised by the video</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:14.280\" end=\"00:03:15.560\" style=\"s2\">and by the report.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:15.560\" end=\"00:03:19.140\" style=\"s2\">[PewDiePie]: Basically saying<br />that the yellow icon alone</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:19.140\" end=\"00:03:21.100\" style=\"s2\">doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t impact search and discovery,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:21.100\" end=\"00:03:23.980\" style=\"s2\">but if the video is also<br />not suitable for a wider audience,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:23.980\" end=\"00:03:25.620\" style=\"s2\">then it might see a poorer performance.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:25.620\" end=\"00:03:28.160\" style=\"s2\">So they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re basically saying,<br />\\xe2\\x80\\x9cif it gets demonetized,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:28.160\" end=\"00:03:31.340\" style=\"s2\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit has nothing to do<br />with lower views, okay?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:32.100\" end=\"00:03:36.780\" style=\"s2\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut if a video has, uh,<br />explicit content,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:36.780\" end=\"00:03:39.120\" style=\"s2\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not gonna get as many views.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:39.120\" end=\"00:03:43.020\" style=\"s2\">The yellow icon doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t limit videos<br />in search and discovery, they said.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:43.020\" end=\"00:03:44.180\" style=\"s2\">The yellow icon.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:44.180\" end=\"00:03:48.200\" style=\"s2\">Now, a lot of people know<br />the yellow icon means demonetized,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:48.200\" end=\"00:03:50.140\" style=\"s2\">so that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something people recognized,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:50.140\" end=\"00:03:52.840\" style=\"s2\">but that was not really<br />the underlying concern</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:52.840\" end=\"00:03:55.100\" style=\"s2\">about the scanning<br />and the tagging of content.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:55.100\" end=\"00:03:56.960\" style=\"s2\">Just seven days later, Todd B,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:56.960\" end=\"00:03:58.960\" style=\"s2\">the head of search and discovery<br />at YouTube,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:58.960\" end=\"00:04:00.320\" style=\"s2\">came on Creator Insider,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:00.320\" end=\"00:04:03.740\" style=\"s2\">and answered a sort of<br />reformulated softball question</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:03.740\" end=\"00:04:04.914\" style=\"s2\">about demonetization.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:04.914\" end=\"00:04:07.222\" style=\"s2\">-Are those things connected?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:07.222\" end=\"00:04:14.685\" style=\"s2\">-So the the search and discovery systems<br />that decide which videos to recommend,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:14.685\" end=\"00:04:18.480\" style=\"s2\">they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any knowledge about<br />what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on in the advertising system,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:18.480\" end=\"00:04:20.948\" style=\"s2\">so if you get that<br />yellow icon that you see</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:20.948\" end=\"00:04:23.942\" style=\"s2\">that says it may not be<br />suitable for all advertisers,</p>\\n<p

begin=\"00:10:38.605\" end=\"00:10:41.005\" style=\"s2\">Two of these videos were rated mature.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:41.005\" end=\"00:10:45.417\" style=\"s2\">On average, reviews of a mature video<br />are 3.3 million views,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:45.417\" end=\"00:10:50.742\" style=\"s2\">while the non-mature videos<br />have an average of 6.65 million views.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:51.040\" end=\"00:10:55.200\" style=\"s2\">That is just over 50% less views<br />for the mature videos.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:55.200\" end=\"00:10:58.537\" style=\"s2\">The community seem to agree<br />with around 30%,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:58.537\" end=\"00:11:00.994\" style=\"s2\">but that is, of course, in the short term.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:00.994\" end=\"00:11:03.680\" style=\"s2\">These videos showcase<br />the long-term effect,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:03.680\" end=\"00:11:07.508\" style=\"s2\">because when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mature,<br />it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get recommended as much,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:07.508\" end=\"00:11:10.057\" style=\"s2\">which will eventually stack up over time.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:10.765\" end=\"00:11:12.651\" style=\"s2\">But as our research showed,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:12.651\" end=\"00:11:15.794\" style=\"s2\">the impact is much bigger<br />for smaller creators.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:15.794\" end=\"00:11:19.268\" style=\"s2\">So the second wave of this ad campaign<br />hunting for mature videos,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:19.268\" end=\"00:11:23.131\" style=\"s2\">this time targeted LGBTQ channels<br />and women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s issues channels.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:23.131\" end=\"00:11:26.502\" style=\"s2\">The list of confirmed M-rated videos<br />include Me Too videos</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:26.502\" end=\"00:11:29.028\" style=\"s2\">like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy Story: Rape in College,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:29.028\" end=\"00:11:30.480\" style=\"s2\">coming out videos like,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:30.480\" end=\"00:11:32.902\" style=\"s2\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cComing out (or not)<br />as a Gay Sri lankan Teen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:32.902\" end=\"00:11:37.314\" style=\"s2\">and videos concerning gay rights issues<br />like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHomosexuality in Chechnya,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:37.314\" end=\"00:11:40.594\" style=\"s2\">also \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGrowing up illegally gay<br />Four life stories.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:40.594\" end=\"00:11:43.485\" style=\"s2\">these are people who are<br />speaking out about sexual abuse,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:43.485\" end=\"00:11:46.457\" style=\"s2\">or against homophobia, being rated M.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:46.457\" end=\"00:11:50.217\" style=\"s2\">These voices, which I believe<br />that YouTube leadership does care about,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:50.217\" end=\"00:11:53.280\" style=\"s2\">are being suppressed<br />by this clumsy rating system.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:53.280\" end=\"00:11:57.600\" style=\"s2\">so with that concerning pattern appearing,<br />the last leg of the ad campaign</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:57.600\" end=\"00:11:59.520\" style=\"s2\">targeted these keywords specifically.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:59.520\" end=\"00:12:02.594\" style=\"s2\">They placed ads on videos<br />related to coming out of the closet,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:02.594\" end=\"00:12:04.514\" style=\"s2\">suicide prevention, and Me Too.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:04.514\" end=\"00:12:07.954\" style=\"s2\">the videos that were rated mature<br />along that keyword cloud</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:07.954\" end=\"00:12:09.771\" style=\"s2\">are heartbreaking to see.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:09.771\" end=\"00:12:12.022\" style=\"s2\">This is clearly where the results<br />are the most concerning,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:12.022\" end=\"00:12:14.240\" style=\"s2\">because the bot can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem<br />to tell the difference</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:14.240\" end=\"00:12:17.485\" style=\"s2\">between a video that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say,<br />making light of suicide,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:17.485\" end=\"00:12:20.800\" style=\"s2\">and a video that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aimed at<br />dissuading people who are suicidal</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:20.800\" end=\"00:12:21.817\" style=\"s2\">from going through with it.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:21.817\" end=\"00:12:23.851\" style=\"s2\">Look at this video for example titled</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:23.851\" end=\"00:12:27.154\" style=\"s2\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBefore You Commit Suicide,<br />Watch This Video First.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:27.154\" end=\"00:12:29.554\" style=\"s2\">The comments are filled<br />with people sharing</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:29.554\" end=\"00:12:31.108\" style=\"s2\">how much this video helped them.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:31.108\" end=\"00:12:34.422\" style=\"s2\">Some people saying that watching it<br />literally saved their life that day.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:34.422\" end=\"00:12:37.211\" style=\"s2\">it was rated M, and made harder to find.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:37.211\" end=\"00:12:38.514\" style=\"s2\">That should not be happening.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:38.514\" end=\"00:12:42.708\" style=\"s2\">if a young person<br />is considering hurting themselves,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:42.708\" end=\"00:12:45.291\" style=\"s2\">this might be<br />the video they need to see.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:45.291\" end=\"00:12:49.817\" style=\"s2\">There should not be an age limit<br />on encouraging people to choose life.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:49.817\" end=\"00:12:52.217\" style=\"s2\">Next on the list, and similarly affected,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:52.217\" end=\"00:12:55.500\" style=\"s2\">we see first-person revelations<br />of sexual misconduct.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:55.500\" end=\"00:12:58.297\" style=\"s2\">Part of the Me Too movement rated M.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:58.297\" end=\"00:13:02.730\" style=\"s2\">The recent openness about sharing<br />and listening to stories like this</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:02.730\" end=\"00:13:07.771\" style=\"s2\">was an important cultural moment,<br />and censoring that directly undermines it.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:07.771\" end=\"00:13:10.914\" style=\"s2\">there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evidence that<br />tagging \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMetoo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the metadata,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:10.914\" end=\"00:13:12.845\" style=\"s2\">or putting Metoo in the title,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:12.845\" end=\"00:13:16.057\" style=\"s2\">whitelists it from<br />the content rating system,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:16.057\" end=\"00:13:17.497\" style=\"s2\">but no one was told that.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:17.497\" end=\"00:13:18.880\" style=\"s2\">That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a clean solution</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:18.880\" end=\"00:13:22.491\" style=\"s2\">if the whitelist is just<br />quietly implemented by a programmer,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:22.491\" end=\"00:13:24.400\" style=\"s2\">and never communicated to the community.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:24.400\" end=\"00:13:28.685\" style=\"s2\">Regular people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a crystal ball<br />about what metadata to use for a video,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:28.685\" end=\"00:13:32.960\" style=\"s2\">so not every video related to Me Too<br />used that hashtag,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:32.960\" end=\"00:13:36.514\" style=\"s2\">and they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in the future,<br />not if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell people.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:36.514\" end=\"00:13:38.308\" style=\"s2\">YouTube is in a tough position.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:38.308\" end=\"00:13:40.388\" style=\"s2\">Whatever they do,<br />they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re gonna get slammed,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:40.388\" end=\"00:13:42.822\" style=\"s2\">and on tricky topics, in lots of cases,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:42.822\" end=\"00:13:46.937\" style=\"s2\">depending who they side with<br />determines who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gonna try to sue them.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:46.937\" end=\"00:13:50.160\" style=\"s2\">One theory I have for why YouTube<br />will never be completely forthcoming</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:50.160\" end=\"00:13:52.205\" style=\"s2\">about what their scanning bots can do</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:52.205\" end=\"00:13:53.942\" style=\"s2\">has to do with U.S. copyright law.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:53.942\" end=\"00:13:57.177\" style=\"s2\">In order to benefit from<br />the safe harbor provisions of the DMCA,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:57.177\" end=\"00:13:58.731\" style=\"s2\">YouTube needs to be able to argue</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:58.731\" end=\"00:14:01.440\" style=\"s2\">that they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have actual<br />or red-flagged knowledge</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:01.440\" end=\"00:14:03.702\" style=\"s2\">that users are uploading<br />infringing materials.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:03.702\" end=\"00:14:06.320\" style=\"s2\">But the better that<br />this artificial intelligence gets,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:06.320\" end=\"00:14:08.297\" style=\"s2\">the better that the machine learning gets,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:08.297\" end=\"00:14:12.422\" style=\"s2\">the more they have to admit that, yeah,<br />they can kind of tell what everything is</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:12.422\" end=\"00:14:15.417\" style=\"s2\">as soon as it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s uploaded,<br />and while it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still being processed.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:15.417\" end=\"00:14:18.308\" style=\"s2\">But when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re supporting<br />an ecosystem of creators</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:18.308\" end=\"00:14:20.331\" style=\"s2\">who rely on this platform for a job,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:20.331\" end=\"00:14:23.280\" style=\"s2\">which YouTube leadership<br />say that they want you to do \\xe2\\x80\\x94</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:23.280\" end=\"00:14:28.434\" style=\"s2\">-So what we stand for<br />is really four freedoms.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:28.434\" end=\"00:14:31.611\" style=\"s2\">freedom of opportunity,<br />anybody to make a living on YouTube;</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:31.611\" end=\"00:14:36.708\" style=\"s2\">freedom of speech, as important as ever;<br />freedom of information, accessing it;</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:36.708\" end=\"00:14:40.100\" style=\"s2\">and then the fourth one<br />is freedom to belong.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:40.100\" end=\"00:14:44.045\" style=\"s2\">-That puts an enormous responsibility<br />for communication and fair play</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:44.045\" end=\"00:14:45.382\" style=\"s2\">on the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s back.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:45.382\" end=\"00:14:48.080\" style=\"s2\">YouTube grew and grew and grew at any cost</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:48.080\" end=\"00:14:50.274\" style=\"s2\">in order to become<br />the dominant video platform,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:50.274\" end=\"00:14:53.360\" style=\"s2\">while the competition<br />was crushed or faded away,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:53.360\" end=\"00:14:56.411\" style=\"s2\">so they asked for this.<br />They wanted this.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:56.411\" end=\"00:14:59.645\" style=\"s2\">YouTube is the number two<br />most visited site in the world,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:59.645\" end=\"00:15:01.988\" style=\"s2\">second only<br />to the search engine that owns it.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:01.988\" end=\"00:15:04.331\" style=\"s2\">That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the whole internet<br />building around it.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:04.331\" end=\"00:15:06.720\" style=\"s2\">That is the world on its shoulders.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:06.720\" end=\"00:15:10.140\" style=\"s2\">In a year where the CEO of YouTube,<br />Susan Wojcicki, has promised</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:10.140\" end=\"00:15:15.645\" style=\"s2\">better communication and clearer policies,<br />there are a lot of people, including me,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:15.645\" end=\"00:15:17.120\" style=\"s2\">counting on this to get better.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:17.120\" end=\"00:15:21.131\" style=\"s2\">So, solution: let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s have some clarity<br />on this rating system.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:21.131\" end=\"00:15:24.765\" style=\"s2\">What specifically triggers a rating<br />on a video-to-video basis?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:24.765\" end=\"00:15:28.342\" style=\"s2\">I know we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got some buffoons here,<br />but trust your content creators</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:28.342\" end=\"00:15:31.142\" style=\"s2\">to build their content<br />to fit within those guidelines.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:31.142\" end=\"00:15:34.320\" style=\"s2\">They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll adapt if they just<br />know what they need to adapt.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:34.320\" end=\"00:15:37.760\" style=\"s2\">We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re already seeing that happening<br />as channels learn the hard way</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:37.760\" end=\"00:15:40.708\" style=\"s2\">and start trying to teach each other<br />what works/what doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:40.708\" end=\"00:15:44.948\" style=\"s2\">Hey, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t upload puke videos,<br />don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgun\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the title,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:44.948\" end=\"00:15:49.794\" style=\"s2\">use use the satire tag,<br />use the Metoo tag if that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accurate.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:49.794\" end=\"00:15:53.954\" style=\"s2\">This information should be<br />coming from YouTube, not Nerd City.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:53.954\" end=\"00:15:55.245\" style=\"s2\">Not me, right?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:55.245\" end=\"00:15:57.828\" style=\"s2\">Not independent Swedish researchers</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:57.828\" end=\"00:16:00.274\" style=\"s2\">who have to poke the site<br />to see what it does.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:00.274\" end=\"00:16:03.130\" style=\"s2\">We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to create things<br />that will be entertaining,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:03.130\" end=\"00:16:05.005\" style=\"s2\">and that will be seen by people,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:05.005\" end=\"00:16:08.190\" style=\"s2\">but the implementation<br />for the rules on how to do that</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:08.190\" end=\"00:16:12.045\" style=\"s2\">changes from day to day<br />and from week to week \\xe2\\x80\\x94 secretly \\xe2\\x80\\x94</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:12.045\" end=\"00:16:15.760\" style=\"s2\">and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incredibly frustrating<br />to have to figure that out yourself</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:15.760\" end=\"00:16:19.017\" style=\"s2\">from trial and error,<br />or from other creators,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:19.017\" end=\"00:16:20.537\" style=\"s2\">or from whistleblowers.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:20.537\" end=\"00:16:22.468\" style=\"s2\">The best documentation we have</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:22.468\" end=\"00:16:25.120\" style=\"s2\">for understanding<br />what would trigger these ratings</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:25.120\" end=\"00:16:26.308\" style=\"s2\">comes from a leak.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:26.308\" end=\"00:16:29.154\" style=\"s2\">Thanks to Tower Dog,<br />whoever the fuck that is,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:29.154\" end=\"00:16:32.388\" style=\"s2\">we have a few pages of a document<br />that was being used</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:32.388\" end=\"00:16:35.782\" style=\"s2\">by human manual reviewers<br />to look at YouTube videos,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:35.782\" end=\"00:16:37.428\" style=\"s2\">but the source was anonymous.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:37.428\" end=\"00:16:41.897\" style=\"s2\">This came out a few months ago<br />before the whole Logan Paul Japan debacle,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:41.897\" end=\"00:16:44.731\" style=\"s2\">so the rules could\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve changed by now.<br />They probably did.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:44.731\" end=\"00:16:47.245\" style=\"s2\">Why can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we have<br />something like this on the up-and-up?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:47.245\" end=\"00:16:49.394\" style=\"s2\">why can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we get<br />something better than this?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:49.394\" end=\"00:16:54.651\" style=\"s2\">Sure, there are nice Q&amp;A sessions<br />on the creator insider channel now,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:54.651\" end=\"00:16:57.360\" style=\"s2\">but at the end of the day,<br />we still have to upload a video,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:57.360\" end=\"00:17:00.457\" style=\"s2\">and then get a result<br />which we interpret ourselves</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:00.457\" end=\"00:17:02.788\" style=\"s2\">based off of an on or off switch.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:02.788\" end=\"00:17:04.114\" style=\"s2\">Nothing is more frustrating</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:04.114\" end=\"00:17:07.245\" style=\"s2\">than spending days<br />or even weeks on a video,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:07.245\" end=\"00:17:09.942\"

begin=\"00:19:09.988\" end=\"00:19:12.731\" style=\"s2\">A few years ago,<br />if you were a mom-and-pop business,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:12.731\" end=\"00:19:14.720\" style=\"s2\">and you wanted<br />to put up a website for that business,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:14.720\" end=\"00:19:17.897\" style=\"s2\">you had to cobble together a bunch<br />of different skillsets to do that.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:17.897\" end=\"00:19:20.502\" style=\"s2\">You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have to hire a web developer<br />to build the site,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:20.502\" end=\"00:19:24.285\" style=\"s2\">and then bug them to make changes for you<br />every time the site needed to be updated.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:24.285\" end=\"00:19:27.257\" style=\"s2\">not to mention the whole issue<br />of actually hosting the site,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:27.257\" end=\"00:19:29.154\" style=\"s2\">or buying the domain in the first place.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:29.154\" end=\"00:19:32.422\" style=\"s2\">Each of those things<br />requiring some know-how,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:32.422\" end=\"00:19:34.217\" style=\"s2\">or signing up for a different service.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:34.217\" end=\"00:19:36.114\" style=\"s2\">And then Squarespace came along,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:36.114\" end=\"00:19:37.542\" style=\"s2\">and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve probably<br />heard their name by now,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:37.542\" end=\"00:19:39.840\" style=\"s2\">because they actually did<br />something pretty valuable \\xe2\\x80\\x94</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:39.840\" end=\"00:19:42.537\" style=\"s2\">they took all of those things,<br />and they put them in one place.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:42.537\" end=\"00:19:44.045\" style=\"s2\">If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like most people I know,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:44.045\" end=\"00:19:46.742\" style=\"s2\">and you know absolutely nothing<br />about building a website,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:46.742\" end=\"00:19:48.240\" style=\"s2\">then that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty useful,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:48.240\" end=\"00:19:50.422\" style=\"s2\">or even if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re someone who does,<br />and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re an expert,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:50.422\" end=\"00:19:52.297\" style=\"s2\">and you just want to<br />pop something up really easy.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:52.297\" end=\"00:19:53.977\" style=\"s2\">If you think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something you need,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:53.977\" end=\"00:19:56.057\" style=\"s2\">there is a coupon attached<br />to the link below,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:56.057\"

style=\"s2\">So how do we know<br />about this rating system,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:01:32.000\" end=\"00:01:33.900\" style=\"s2\">and what impact does it have on videos?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:01:33.900\" end=\"00:01:37.560\" style=\"s2\">I mean, if you can’t see it as a user,<br />you can’t see it as a creator,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:01:37.560\" end=\"00:01:41.420\" style=\"s2\">and even the YouTube Heroes,<br />the volunteer moderators can’t see it,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:01:41.420\" end=\"00:01:43.060\" style=\"s2\">how do we know it exists?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:01:43.060\" end=\"00:01:46.140\" style=\"s2\">Well, there are several pieces<br />that complete this puzzle,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:01:46.140\" end=\"00:01:49.320\" style=\"s2\">and it involves statements<br />made by YouTube on Twitter,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:01:49.320\" end=\"00:01:52.640\" style=\"s2\">statements made by YouTube<br />employees on YouTube itself,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:01:52.640\" end=\"00:01:57.040\" style=\"s2\">an email exchange between a major YouTuber<br />and their handler at YouTube,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:01:57.040\" end=\"00:01:59.480\" style=\"s2\">and YouTube’s advertising tools<br />within Adwords.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:01:59.480\" end=\"00:02:03.160\" style=\"s2\">For context, let’s start back<br />in December 2017.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:03.160\" end=\"00:02:07.660\" style=\"s2\">This channel made a video<br />talking about secret codes on YouTube.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:07.660\" end=\"00:02:11.760\" style=\"s2\">The video was communicating the findings<br />of a white paper by the Karla Plan Group</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:11.760\" end=\"00:02:14.700\" style=\"s2\">asserting that videos<br />were being secretly tagged</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:14.700\" end=\"00:02:16.840\" style=\"s2\">for their non-advertiser-friendly content,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:16.840\" end=\"00:02:19.140\" style=\"s2\">and then suppressed<br />within search and discovery</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:19.140\" end=\"00:02:20.300\" style=\"s2\">for those tags,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:20.300\" end=\"00:02:25.660\" style=\"s2\">meaning that videos that YouTube bots<br />believed to contain risque content</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:25.660\" end=\"00:02:28.620\" style=\"s2\">were being made harder to find<br />within the tools on YouTube,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:28.620\" end=\"00:02:31.540\" style=\"s2\">like the search bar and all the<br />various recommended feeds</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:31.540\" end=\"00:02:33.580\" style=\"s2\">that are part of the layout of the site.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:33.580\" end=\"00:02:37.020\" style=\"s2\">If you want to see extensive evidence<br />for what algorithmic suppression</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:37.020\" end=\"00:02:38.880\" style=\"s2\">can do to a video’s views,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:38.880\" end=\"00:02:42.020\" style=\"s2\">check out the three reports<br />that are linked in the description.</p>\\n<p

end=\"00:02:47.540\" style=\"s2\">the numbers so far<br />that have been discovered —</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:47.540\" end=\"00:02:49.140\" style=\"s2\">The NUMBERS! What do they MEAN?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:49.140\" end=\"00:02:54.480\" style=\"s2\">H3h3 and PewDiePie amplified this issue<br />on Twitter and with a video,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:54.480\" end=\"00:02:57.460\" style=\"s2\">and other creators started<br />to make videos about this,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:02:57.460\" end=\"00:03:00.640\" style=\"s2\">and YouTube had to deal with it.<br />It became a PR crisis.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:00.640\" end=\"00:03:03.560\" style=\"s2\">Unlike some of their recent<br />Wendy’s-style responses,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:03.560\" end=\"00:03:05.900\" style=\"s2\">they responded — very tactfully.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:05.900\" end=\"00:03:07.600\" style=\"s2\">Like an experienced politician,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:07.600\" end=\"00:03:10.880\" style=\"s2\">they answered the question<br />that they wish they’d been asked,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:10.880\" end=\"00:03:14.280\" style=\"s2\">and not exactly the question<br />that was raised by the video</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:14.280\" end=\"00:03:15.560\" style=\"s2\">and by the report.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:15.560\" end=\"00:03:19.140\" style=\"s2\">[PewDiePie]: Basically saying<br />that the yellow icon alone</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:19.140\" end=\"00:03:21.100\" style=\"s2\">doesn’t impact search and discovery,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:21.100\" end=\"00:03:23.980\" style=\"s2\">but if the video is also<br />not suitable for a wider audience,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:23.980\" end=\"00:03:25.620\" style=\"s2\">then it might see a poorer performance.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:25.620\" end=\"00:03:28.160\" style=\"s2\">So they’re basically saying,<br />“if it gets demonetized,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:28.160\" end=\"00:03:31.340\" style=\"s2\">“it has nothing to do<br />with lower views, okay?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:32.100\" end=\"00:03:36.780\" style=\"s2\">“But if a video has, uh,<br />explicit content,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:36.780\" end=\"00:03:39.120\" style=\"s2\">“then it’s not gonna get as many views.”</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:39.120\" end=\"00:03:43.020\" style=\"s2\">The yellow icon doesn’t limit videos<br />in search and discovery, they said.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:43.020\" end=\"00:03:44.180\" style=\"s2\">The yellow icon.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:44.180\" end=\"00:03:48.200\" style=\"s2\">Now, a lot of people know<br />the yellow icon means demonetized,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:48.200\" end=\"00:03:50.140\" style=\"s2\">so that’s something people recognized,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:50.140\" end=\"00:03:52.840\" style=\"s2\">but that was not really<br />the underlying concern</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:52.840\" end=\"00:03:55.100\" style=\"s2\">about the scanning<br />and the tagging of content.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:55.100\" end=\"00:03:56.960\" style=\"s2\">Just seven days later, Todd B,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:56.960\" end=\"00:03:58.960\" style=\"s2\">the head of search and discovery<br />at YouTube,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:03:58.960\" end=\"00:04:00.320\" style=\"s2\">came on Creator Insider,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:00.320\" end=\"00:04:03.740\" style=\"s2\">and answered a sort of<br />reformulated softball question</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:03.740\" end=\"00:04:04.914\" style=\"s2\">about demonetization.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:04.914\" end=\"00:04:07.222\" style=\"s2\">-Are those things connected?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:07.222\" end=\"00:04:14.685\" style=\"s2\">-So the the search and discovery systems<br />that decide which videos to recommend,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:14.685\" end=\"00:04:18.480\" style=\"s2\">they don’t have any knowledge about<br />what’s going on in the advertising system,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:18.480\" end=\"00:04:20.948\" style=\"s2\">so if you get that<br />yellow icon that you see</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:20.948\" end=\"00:04:23.942\" style=\"s2\">that says it may not be<br />suitable for all advertisers,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:23.942\" end=\"00:04:28.171\" style=\"s2\">the information about that<br />doesn’t even flow into our system.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:28.171\" end=\"00:04:32.217\" style=\"s2\">These things can overlap in terms of,<br />you know,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:32.217\" end=\"00:04:35.325\" style=\"s2\">something that advertisers<br />care about running their ads around</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:35.325\" end=\"00:04:39.645\" style=\"s2\">might be, like, profanity, or violence,<br />or certain controversial topics,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:39.645\" end=\"00:04:41.028\" style=\"s2\">they may decide, you know,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:41.028\" end=\"00:04:44.434\" style=\"s2\">they just don’t want to be<br />associated with that type of content.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:45.131\" end=\"00:04:48.902\" style=\"s2\">Similarly, we may find that<br />audiences have similar preferences.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:48.902\" end=\"00:04:53.291\" style=\"s2\">So we might find that a profane video,<br />for example, may not be</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:53.291\" end=\"00:04:56.582\" style=\"s2\">something that everyone on YouTube<br />is going to be interested in.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:56.582\" end=\"00:04:58.080\" style=\"s2\">I like Creator Insider.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:04:58.080\" end=\"00:05:00.045\" style=\"s2\">I like the guy Tom, who runs it.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:00.045\" end=\"00:05:01.805\" style=\"s2\">I am so glad that channel exists.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:01.805\" end=\"00:05:03.680\" style=\"s2\">I think it’s a good step<br />in the right direction,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:03.680\" end=\"00:05:08.537\" style=\"s2\">but I believe that that answer,<br />and the answer on YouTube’s Twitter,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:08.537\" end=\"00:05:11.988\" style=\"s2\">are meant to protect secrets,<br />and are deliberately misleading.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:12.937\" end=\"00:05:15.977\" style=\"s2\">We have to split a hair here<br />to get to the truth.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:15.977\" end=\"00:05:17.737\" style=\"s2\">Here’s what those two answers imply.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:17.737\" end=\"00:05:19.085\" style=\"s2\">The green or yellow status,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:19.085\" end=\"00:05:23.405\" style=\"s2\">which we can think of as the sort of<br />on or off light representing monetization,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:23.405\" end=\"00:05:26.457\" style=\"s2\">is not fed directly<br />into search and discovery.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:26.457\" end=\"00:05:29.657\" style=\"s2\">The Fisher-Price Baby’s First Adsense tool</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:29.657\" end=\"00:05:32.422\" style=\"s2\">to let YouTubers know<br />if they’re gonna get paid or not,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:32.800\" end=\"00:05:35.371\" style=\"s2\">that’s not being used<br />by YouTube’s algorithm.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:35.371\" end=\"00:05:36.662\" style=\"s2\">Okay, fine.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:36.662\" end=\"00:05:40.217\" style=\"s2\">However, the root causes<br />of a video being demonetized,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:40.217\" end=\"00:05:41.565\" style=\"s2\">and let’s say “Rated M,”</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:41.565\" end=\"00:05:44.902\" style=\"s2\">which comes as a result of<br />layers of machine learning algorithms</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:44.902\" end=\"00:05:48.297\" style=\"s2\">scanning, identifying, sorting,<br />and rating the content</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:48.297\" end=\"00:05:51.700\" style=\"s2\">based on its tags, title, thumbnails,<br />and closed captions,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:51.700\" end=\"00:05:53.440\" style=\"s2\">is affecting search and discovery.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:53.440\" end=\"00:05:55.820\" style=\"s2\">That’s the important thing.<br />They’re admitting it there.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:55.820\" end=\"00:05:58.560\" style=\"s2\">It’s a it’s an admission<br />that sounds like a denial.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:05:58.560\" end=\"00:06:00.948\" style=\"s2\">They’re saying yes and no<br />at the same time.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:00.948\" end=\"00:06:03.497\" style=\"s2\">It’s like tennis,<br />it’s like going back and forth.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:03.497\" end=\"00:06:07.828\" style=\"s2\">Hey, ha! Hey! We dodged around the issue!</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:08.034\" end=\"00:06:12.125\" style=\"s2\">And all of those interpretations of videos<br />made by machines</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:12.125\" end=\"00:06:17.085\" style=\"s2\">aren’t being explained to YouTubers,<br />can’t even be seen, and can’t be appealed.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:17.085\" end=\"00:06:20.190\" style=\"s2\">so let’s boil it down to<br />“the yellow light doesn’t do anything.”</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:20.190\" end=\"00:06:23.062\" style=\"s2\">Does that answer all your questions,<br />you nosy creators?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:23.062\" end=\"00:06:25.828\" style=\"s2\">the next piece of evidence<br />about the secret rating system</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:25.828\" end=\"00:06:28.571\" style=\"s2\">comes from Kwebbelkop,<br />who if you don’t already know,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:28.571\" end=\"00:06:31.428\" style=\"s2\">is a huge let’s play YouTuber<br />with about 8 million subscribers.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:31.428\" end=\"00:06:34.034\" style=\"s2\">YouTube holds these<br />VIP meetings for creators</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:34.034\" end=\"00:06:35.885\" style=\"s2\">at what they call<br />their “creator spaces.”</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:35.885\" end=\"00:06:37.714\" style=\"s2\">PewDiePie was just at one in London.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:37.714\" end=\"00:06:40.640\" style=\"s2\">St one of these meetings,<br />at the London creator space,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:40.640\" end=\"00:06:43.988\" style=\"s2\">Kwebbelkop heard something in the meeting<br />that kind of piqued his interest,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:43.988\" end=\"00:06:46.925\" style=\"s2\">So he followed up on it in an email<br />to his handler at YouTube.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:46.925\" end=\"00:06:49.554\" style=\"s2\">He wanted to know if his channel<br />was considered kid-friendly,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:49.554\" end=\"00:06:51.942\" style=\"s2\">and if not what he could do<br />to change that.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:51.942\" end=\"00:06:53.440\" style=\"s2\">The reply he got states,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:53.440\" end=\"00:06:55.508\" style=\"s2\">“I checked your channel,<br />and I’m happy to say</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:55.508\" end=\"00:06:58.697\" style=\"s2\">“your channel is DV-TEEN.<br />Please keep this confidential.”</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:06:58.697\" end=\"00:07:01.862\" style=\"s2\">that email contains a remarkable<br />piece of information,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:01.862\" end=\"00:07:04.742\" style=\"s2\">and after Kweb shared it,<br />he says he’s been iced out.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:04.742\" end=\"00:07:07.074\" style=\"s2\">He stopped getting invited<br />to those creator space meetings,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:07.074\" end=\"00:07:08.377\" style=\"s2\">that just never happened again.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:08.377\" end=\"00:07:10.720\" style=\"s2\">In his own words to me,<br />he feels he’s been blacklisted.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:10.720\" end=\"00:07:14.057\" style=\"s2\">Ss you see in the email, he was asked<br />not to share this information.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:14.057\" end=\"00:07:15.497\" style=\"s2\">Why? Who knows?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:15.497\" end=\"00:07:18.685\" style=\"s2\">This is the kind of specific information<br />that can help a channel</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:18.685\" end=\"00:07:21.165\" style=\"s2\">understand what’s happening to them,<br />so he shared it.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:21.165\" end=\"00:07:23.485\" style=\"s2\">I say good for him for doing that,<br />and thank you.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:23.485\" end=\"00:07:27.314\" style=\"s2\">Whenever youtubers get a press release,<br />or an official posting by the CEO</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:27.314\" end=\"00:07:28.617\" style=\"s2\">on the blog,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:28.617\" end=\"00:07:31.474\" style=\"s2\">the wording is always<br />so intentionally vague</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:31.474\" end=\"00:07:33.965\" style=\"s2\">that we can’t understand<br />what the words literally mean</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:33.965\" end=\"00:07:35.988\" style=\"s2\">without sort of busting apart the language</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:35.988\" end=\"00:07:39.108\" style=\"s2\">and trying to apply it<br />to other unconfirmed assumptions</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:39.108\" end=\"00:07:40.525\" style=\"s2\">about how the website works.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:40.525\" end=\"00:07:43.400\" style=\"s2\">It’s as if they’re taking their<br />internal policies and memos</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:43.400\" end=\"00:07:45.360\" style=\"s2\">and feeding them into a confuser machine.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:45.360\" end=\"00:07:49.382\" style=\"s2\">even for a community of people<br />who are relatively gifted with language,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:49.382\" end=\"00:07:53.062\" style=\"s2\">it’s maddening to try and reassemble<br />the meaning out of these releases.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:53.062\" end=\"00:07:55.931\" style=\"s2\">Thankfully, though,<br />on the AdWords side of YouTube,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:55.931\" end=\"00:07:59.530\" style=\"s2\">where advertisers are actually<br />pumping their money into the platform,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:07:59.530\" end=\"00:08:03.480\" style=\"s2\">the structure of YouTube reveals itself;<br />things are a little more cut-and-dry.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:03.480\" end=\"00:08:06.308\" style=\"s2\">If you’re running an ad campaign,<br />and you want to limit your ad</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:06.308\" end=\"00:08:09.017\" style=\"s2\">to play on videos<br />that are rated G, or T, or M,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:09.017\" end=\"00:08:11.325\" style=\"s2\">You can simply click a tab that, well,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:12.594\" end=\"00:08:13.840\" style=\"s2\">abracadabra.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:13.840\" end=\"00:08:16.868\" style=\"s2\">if you still had any doubt,<br />there’s your video ratings.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:16.868\" end=\"00:08:19.874\" style=\"s2\">This tool would not work,<br />and it would not be structured this way,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:19.874\" end=\"00:08:22.811\" style=\"s2\">if videos were not being rated internally.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:22.811\" end=\"00:08:25.085\" style=\"s2\">We can use this tool<br />to gather information,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:25.085\" end=\"00:08:28.182\" style=\"s2\">and sort of reverse engineer<br />the way that the system works.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:28.182\" end=\"00:08:31.634\" style=\"s2\">By excluding all tabs but one<br />and then collecting information</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:31.634\" end=\"00:08:33.170\" style=\"s2\">on where your ads were placed,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:33.170\" end=\"00:08:36.685\" style=\"s2\">you can build a list of videos<br />that fall into just one category.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:36.685\" end=\"00:08:39.440\" style=\"s2\">If you build a list of videos<br />that are, say, rated M,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:39.440\" end=\"00:08:41.531\" style=\"s2\">then maybe we can look at<br />the videos on that list,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:41.531\" end=\"00:08:43.520\" style=\"s2\">and better understand the rating system</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:43.520\" end=\"00:08:45.874\" style=\"s2\">as it’s applied<br />to all videos across the site.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:45.874\" end=\"00:08:48.902\" style=\"s2\">Sealow and Karlaplan Group<br />created a research project</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:48.902\" end=\"00:08:49.920\" style=\"s2\">to do exactly that.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:49.920\" end=\"00:08:51.874\" style=\"s2\">For one month, they ran ad campaigns</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:51.874\" end=\"00:08:54.480\" style=\"s2\">excluding everything except<br />videos rated mature,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:54.480\" end=\"00:08:59.485\" style=\"s2\">and targeting the channels of<br />H3h3, PewDiePie, IdubbbzTV, Leafyishere,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:08:59.485\" end=\"00:09:02.530\" style=\"s2\">DramaAlert, Internet Comment Etiquette,<br />and I Hate Everything.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:02.530\" end=\"00:09:05.691\" style=\"s2\">The videos that had ads placed on them<br />according to this rule</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:05.691\" end=\"00:09:09.120\" style=\"s2\">created a data set<br />of confirmed rated M videos.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:09.120\" end=\"00:09:12.020\" style=\"s2\">Many of PewDiePie’s videos<br />were revealed as rated M,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:12.020\" end=\"00:09:15.530\" style=\"s2\">and those videos all performed<br />very poorly compared to his other videos,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:15.530\" end=\"00:09:16.914\" style=\"s2\">but we’ll get into that in a second.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:16.914\" end=\"00:09:20.080\" style=\"s2\">None of I Hate Everything’s videos<br />were served under the mature filter.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:20.080\" end=\"00:09:23.177\" style=\"s2\">He’s even said on Twitter that he thinks<br />the bot is passing right over him.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:23.177\" end=\"00:09:24.180\" style=\"s2\">But why?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:24.180\" end=\"00:09:27.885\" style=\"s2\">Possibly because he’s doing something<br />that the other guys don’t.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:27.885\" end=\"00:09:31.931\" style=\"s2\">I Hate Everything self-tags his videos<br />as satire when he uploads.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:31.931\" end=\"00:09:35.211\" style=\"s2\">The satire tag seems to create<br />some kind of flexibility</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:35.211\" end=\"00:09:37.714\" style=\"s2\">that’s protecting his videos<br />from the content filter.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:37.714\" end=\"00:09:41.062\" style=\"s2\">So I Hate Everything has benefited from<br />this satire tag loophole,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:41.062\" end=\"00:09:43.485\" style=\"s2\">perhaps without even knowing<br />it was the reason why,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:43.485\" end=\"00:09:45.222\" style=\"s2\">meanwhile other content creators,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:45.222\" end=\"00:09:47.702\" style=\"s2\">who also employ satire<br />as a form of comedy,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:47.702\" end=\"00:09:50.502\" style=\"s2\">like H3 and PewDiePie and Idubbbz and ICE,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:50.502\" end=\"00:09:54.210\" style=\"s2\">have all had their catalogues of content<br />slammed by this mature rating,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:54.210\" end=\"00:09:57.200\" style=\"s2\">-And I really want to talk about this,<br />because I’m pissed,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:57.200\" end=\"00:09:59.314\" style=\"s2\">and I’m probably<br />more pissed than I should be.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:09:59.314\" end=\"00:10:02.331\" style=\"s2\">-They show up on your videos,<br />and that’s what it feels like. Pissed.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:02.331\" end=\"00:10:04.857\" style=\"s2\">You got pissed on your soul,<br />and now you’re pissed,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:04.857\" end=\"00:10:06.685\" style=\"s2\">’cause most of the time<br />it just doesn’t make any sense.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:06.685\" end=\"00:10:09.817\" style=\"s2\">-Alright, listen, what we’re gonna do here<br />is we’re gonna take away their money,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:09.817\" end=\"00:10:11.610\" style=\"s2\">and we’re not gonna fuckin’ tell ’em.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:12.830\" end=\"00:10:15.908\" style=\"s2\">“Don’t you think we should just<br />talk to our creators?”</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:17.062\" end=\"00:10:20.380\" style=\"s2\">That’s the YouTube way, isn’t it?<br />Why would they talk to their creators?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:20.380\" end=\"00:10:22.411\" style=\"s2\">Better communication about this<br />from YouTube</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:22.411\" end=\"00:10:25.337\" style=\"s2\">could have saved those creators<br />a lot of grief and confusion,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:25.337\" end=\"00:10:28.434\" style=\"s2\">not to mention<br />all of the creators downstream</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:28.434\" end=\"00:10:32.057\" style=\"s2\">who are creating similar content,<br />and that mature rating matters,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:32.057\" end=\"00:10:34.640\" style=\"s2\">as Sealow, the lead researcher,<br />puts it here.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:34.640\" end=\"00:10:38.605\" style=\"s2\">-Here are 10 videos from PewDiePie<br />that were uploaded nine months ago.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:38.605\" end=\"00:10:41.005\" style=\"s2\">Two of these videos were rated mature.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:41.005\" end=\"00:10:45.417\" style=\"s2\">On average, reviews of a mature video<br />are 3.3 million views,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:45.417\" end=\"00:10:50.742\" style=\"s2\">while the non-mature videos<br />have an average of 6.65 million views.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:51.040\" end=\"00:10:55.200\" style=\"s2\">That is just over 50% less views<br />for the mature videos.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:55.200\" end=\"00:10:58.537\" style=\"s2\">The community seem to agree<br />with around 30%,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:10:58.537\" end=\"00:11:00.994\" style=\"s2\">but that is, of course, in the short term.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:00.994\" end=\"00:11:03.680\" style=\"s2\">These videos showcase<br />the long-term effect,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:03.680\" end=\"00:11:07.508\" style=\"s2\">because when it’s mature,<br />it won’t get recommended as much,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:07.508\" end=\"00:11:10.057\" style=\"s2\">which will eventually stack up over time.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:10.765\" end=\"00:11:12.651\" style=\"s2\">But as our research showed,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:12.651\" end=\"00:11:15.794\" style=\"s2\">the impact is much bigger<br />for smaller creators.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:15.794\" end=\"00:11:19.268\" style=\"s2\">So the second wave of this ad campaign<br />hunting for mature videos,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:19.268\" end=\"00:11:23.131\" style=\"s2\">this time targeted LGBTQ channels<br />and women’s issues channels.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:23.131\" end=\"00:11:26.502\" style=\"s2\">The list of confirmed M-rated videos<br />include Me Too videos</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:26.502\" end=\"00:11:29.028\" style=\"s2\">like “My Story: Rape in College,”</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:29.028\" end=\"00:11:30.480\" style=\"s2\">coming out videos like,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:30.480\" end=\"00:11:32.902\" style=\"s2\">“Coming out (or not)<br />as a Gay Sri lankan Teen,”</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:32.902\" end=\"00:11:37.314\" style=\"s2\">and videos concerning gay rights issues<br />like “Homosexuality in Chechnya,”</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:37.314\" end=\"00:11:40.594\" style=\"s2\">also “Growing up illegally gay<br />Four life stories.”</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:40.594\" end=\"00:11:43.485\" style=\"s2\">these are people who are<br />speaking out about sexual abuse,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:43.485\" end=\"00:11:46.457\" style=\"s2\">or against homophobia, being rated M.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:46.457\" end=\"00:11:50.217\" style=\"s2\">These voices, which I believe<br />that YouTube leadership does care about,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:50.217\" end=\"00:11:53.280\" style=\"s2\">are being suppressed<br />by this clumsy rating system.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:53.280\" end=\"00:11:57.600\" style=\"s2\">so with that concerning pattern appearing,<br />the last leg of the ad campaign</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:57.600\" end=\"00:11:59.520\" style=\"s2\">targeted these keywords specifically.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:11:59.520\" end=\"00:12:02.594\" style=\"s2\">They placed ads on videos<br />related to coming out of the closet,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:02.594\" end=\"00:12:04.514\" style=\"s2\">suicide prevention, and Me Too.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:04.514\" end=\"00:12:07.954\" style=\"s2\">the videos that were rated mature<br />along that keyword cloud</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:07.954\" end=\"00:12:09.771\" style=\"s2\">are heartbreaking to see.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:09.771\" end=\"00:12:12.022\" style=\"s2\">This is clearly where the results<br />are the most concerning,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:12.022\" end=\"00:12:14.240\" style=\"s2\">because the bot can’t seem<br />to tell the difference</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:14.240\" end=\"00:12:17.485\" style=\"s2\">between a video that’s, let’s say,<br />making light of suicide,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:17.485\" end=\"00:12:20.800\" style=\"s2\">and a video that’s aimed at<br />dissuading people who are suicidal</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:20.800\" end=\"00:12:21.817\" style=\"s2\">from going through with it.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:21.817\" end=\"00:12:23.851\" style=\"s2\">Look at this video for example titled</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:23.851\" end=\"00:12:27.154\" style=\"s2\">“Before You Commit Suicide,<br />Watch This Video First.”</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:27.154\" end=\"00:12:29.554\" style=\"s2\">The comments are filled<br />with people sharing</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:29.554\" end=\"00:12:31.108\" style=\"s2\">how much this video helped them.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:31.108\" end=\"00:12:34.422\" style=\"s2\">Some people saying that watching it<br />literally saved their life that day.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:34.422\" end=\"00:12:37.211\" style=\"s2\">it was rated M, and made harder to find.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:37.211\" end=\"00:12:38.514\" style=\"s2\">That should not be happening.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:38.514\" end=\"00:12:42.708\" style=\"s2\">if a young person<br />is considering hurting themselves,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:42.708\" end=\"00:12:45.291\" style=\"s2\">this might be<br />the video they need to see.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:45.291\" end=\"00:12:49.817\" style=\"s2\">There should not be an age limit<br />on encouraging people to choose life.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:49.817\" end=\"00:12:52.217\" style=\"s2\">Next on the list, and similarly affected,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:52.217\" end=\"00:12:55.500\" style=\"s2\">we see first-person revelations<br />of sexual misconduct.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:55.500\" end=\"00:12:58.297\" style=\"s2\">Part of the Me Too movement rated M.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:12:58.297\" end=\"00:13:02.730\" style=\"s2\">The recent openness about sharing<br />and listening to stories like this</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:02.730\" end=\"00:13:07.771\" style=\"s2\">was an important cultural moment,<br />and censoring that directly undermines it.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:07.771\" end=\"00:13:10.914\" style=\"s2\">there’s evidence that<br />tagging “Metoo” in the metadata,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:10.914\" end=\"00:13:12.845\" style=\"s2\">or putting Metoo in the title,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:12.845\" end=\"00:13:16.057\" style=\"s2\">whitelists it from<br />the content rating system,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:16.057\" end=\"00:13:17.497\" style=\"s2\">but no one was told that.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:17.497\" end=\"00:13:18.880\" style=\"s2\">That’s not a clean solution</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:18.880\" end=\"00:13:22.491\" style=\"s2\">if the whitelist is just<br />quietly implemented by a programmer,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:22.491\" end=\"00:13:24.400\" style=\"s2\">and never communicated to the community.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:24.400\" end=\"00:13:28.685\" style=\"s2\">Regular people don’t have a crystal ball<br />about what metadata to use for a video,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:28.685\" end=\"00:13:32.960\" style=\"s2\">so not every video related to Me Too<br />used that hashtag,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:32.960\" end=\"00:13:36.514\" style=\"s2\">and they won’t in the future,<br />not if you don’t tell people.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:36.514\" end=\"00:13:38.308\" style=\"s2\">YouTube is in a tough position.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:38.308\" end=\"00:13:40.388\" style=\"s2\">Whatever they do,<br />they’re gonna get slammed,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:40.388\" end=\"00:13:42.822\" style=\"s2\">and on tricky topics, in lots of cases,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:42.822\" end=\"00:13:46.937\" style=\"s2\">depending who they side with<br />determines who’s gonna try to sue them.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:46.937\" end=\"00:13:50.160\" style=\"s2\">One theory I have for why YouTube<br />will never be completely forthcoming</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:50.160\" end=\"00:13:52.205\" style=\"s2\">about what their scanning bots can do</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:52.205\" end=\"00:13:53.942\" style=\"s2\">has to do with U.S. copyright law.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:53.942\" end=\"00:13:57.177\" style=\"s2\">In order to benefit from<br />the safe harbor provisions of the DMCA,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:57.177\" end=\"00:13:58.731\" style=\"s2\">YouTube needs to be able to argue</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:13:58.731\" end=\"00:14:01.440\" style=\"s2\">that they don’t have actual<br />or red-flagged knowledge</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:01.440\" end=\"00:14:03.702\" style=\"s2\">that users are uploading<br />infringing materials.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:03.702\" end=\"00:14:06.320\" style=\"s2\">But the better that<br />this artificial intelligence gets,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:06.320\" end=\"00:14:08.297\" style=\"s2\">the better that the machine learning gets,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:08.297\" end=\"00:14:12.422\" style=\"s2\">the more they have to admit that, yeah,<br />they can kind of tell what everything is</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:12.422\" end=\"00:14:15.417\" style=\"s2\">as soon as it’s uploaded,<br />and while it’s still being processed.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:15.417\" end=\"00:14:18.308\" style=\"s2\">But when you’re supporting<br />an ecosystem of creators</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:18.308\" end=\"00:14:20.331\" style=\"s2\">who rely on this platform for a job,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:20.331\" end=\"00:14:23.280\" style=\"s2\">which YouTube leadership<br />say that they want you to do —</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:23.280\" end=\"00:14:28.434\" style=\"s2\">-So what we stand for<br />is really four freedoms.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:28.434\" end=\"00:14:31.611\" style=\"s2\">freedom of opportunity,<br />anybody to make a living on YouTube;</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:31.611\" end=\"00:14:36.708\" style=\"s2\">freedom of speech, as important as ever;<br />freedom of information, accessing it;</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:36.708\" end=\"00:14:40.100\" style=\"s2\">and then the fourth one<br />is freedom to belong.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:40.100\" end=\"00:14:44.045\" style=\"s2\">-That puts an enormous responsibility<br />for communication and fair play</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:44.045\" end=\"00:14:45.382\" style=\"s2\">on the company’s back.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:45.382\" end=\"00:14:48.080\" style=\"s2\">YouTube grew and grew and grew at any cost</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:48.080\" end=\"00:14:50.274\" style=\"s2\">in order to become<br />the dominant video platform,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:50.274\" end=\"00:14:53.360\" style=\"s2\">while the competition<br />was crushed or faded away,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:53.360\" end=\"00:14:56.411\" style=\"s2\">so they asked for this.<br />They wanted this.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:56.411\" end=\"00:14:59.645\" style=\"s2\">YouTube is the number two<br />most visited site in the world,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:14:59.645\" end=\"00:15:01.988\" style=\"s2\">second only<br />to the search engine that owns it.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:01.988\" end=\"00:15:04.331\" style=\"s2\">That’s the whole internet<br />building around it.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:04.331\" end=\"00:15:06.720\" style=\"s2\">That is the world on its shoulders.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:06.720\" end=\"00:15:10.140\" style=\"s2\">In a year where the CEO of YouTube,<br />Susan Wojcicki, has promised</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:10.140\" end=\"00:15:15.645\" style=\"s2\">better communication and clearer policies,<br />there are a lot of people, including me,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:15.645\" end=\"00:15:17.120\" style=\"s2\">counting on this to get better.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:17.120\" end=\"00:15:21.131\" style=\"s2\">So, solution: let’s have some clarity<br />on this rating system.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:21.131\" end=\"00:15:24.765\" style=\"s2\">What specifically triggers a rating<br />on a video-to-video basis?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:24.765\" end=\"00:15:28.342\" style=\"s2\">I know we’ve got some buffoons here,<br />but trust your content creators</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:28.342\" end=\"00:15:31.142\" style=\"s2\">to build their content<br />to fit within those guidelines.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:31.142\" end=\"00:15:34.320\" style=\"s2\">They’ll adapt if they just<br />know what they need to adapt.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:34.320\" end=\"00:15:37.760\" style=\"s2\">We’re already seeing that happening<br />as channels learn the hard way</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:37.760\" end=\"00:15:40.708\" style=\"s2\">and start trying to teach each other<br />what works/what doesn’t work.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:40.708\" end=\"00:15:44.948\" style=\"s2\">Hey, don’t upload puke videos,<br />don’t put “gun” in the title,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:44.948\" end=\"00:15:49.794\" style=\"s2\">use use the satire tag,<br />use the Metoo tag if that’s accurate.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:49.794\" end=\"00:15:53.954\" style=\"s2\">This information should be<br />coming from YouTube, not Nerd City.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:53.954\" end=\"00:15:55.245\" style=\"s2\">Not me, right?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:55.245\" end=\"00:15:57.828\" style=\"s2\">Not independent Swedish researchers</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:15:57.828\" end=\"00:16:00.274\" style=\"s2\">who have to poke the site<br />to see what it does.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:00.274\" end=\"00:16:03.130\" style=\"s2\">We’re trying to create things<br />that will be entertaining,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:03.130\" end=\"00:16:05.005\" style=\"s2\">and that will be seen by people,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:05.005\" end=\"00:16:08.190\" style=\"s2\">but the implementation<br />for the rules on how to do that</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:08.190\" end=\"00:16:12.045\" style=\"s2\">changes from day to day<br />and from week to week — secretly —</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:12.045\" end=\"00:16:15.760\" style=\"s2\">and it’s incredibly frustrating<br />to have to figure that out yourself</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:15.760\" end=\"00:16:19.017\" style=\"s2\">from trial and error,<br />or from other creators,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:19.017\" end=\"00:16:20.537\" style=\"s2\">or from whistleblowers.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:20.537\" end=\"00:16:22.468\" style=\"s2\">The best documentation we have</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:22.468\" end=\"00:16:25.120\" style=\"s2\">for understanding<br />what would trigger these ratings</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:25.120\" end=\"00:16:26.308\" style=\"s2\">comes from a leak.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:26.308\" end=\"00:16:29.154\" style=\"s2\">Thanks to Tower Dog,<br />whoever the fuck that is,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:29.154\" end=\"00:16:32.388\" style=\"s2\">we have a few pages of a document<br />that was being used</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:32.388\" end=\"00:16:35.782\" style=\"s2\">by human manual reviewers<br />to look at YouTube videos,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:35.782\" end=\"00:16:37.428\" style=\"s2\">but the source was anonymous.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:37.428\" end=\"00:16:41.897\" style=\"s2\">This came out a few months ago<br />before the whole Logan Paul Japan debacle,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:41.897\" end=\"00:16:44.731\" style=\"s2\">so the rules could’ve changed by now.<br />They probably did.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:44.731\" end=\"00:16:47.245\" style=\"s2\">Why can’t we have<br />something like this on the up-and-up?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:47.245\" end=\"00:16:49.394\" style=\"s2\">why can’t we get<br />something better than this?</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:49.394\" end=\"00:16:54.651\" style=\"s2\">Sure, there are nice Q&amp;A sessions<br />on the creator insider channel now,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:54.651\" end=\"00:16:57.360\" style=\"s2\">but at the end of the day,<br />we still have to upload a video,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:16:57.360\" end=\"00:17:00.457\" style=\"s2\">and then get a result<br />which we interpret ourselves</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:00.457\" end=\"00:17:02.788\" style=\"s2\">based off of an on or off switch.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:02.788\"

begin=\"00:17:07.245\" end=\"00:17:09.942\" style=\"s2\">uploading it,<br />having it pick up a mature rating</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:09.942\" end=\"00:17:12.731\" style=\"s2\">secretly behind the scenes —<br />we don’t know why —</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:12.731\" end=\"00:17:16.114\" style=\"s2\">and then instead of being able<br />to move on to the next creative process,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:16.114\" end=\"00:17:19.577\" style=\"s2\">or let’s say take care of responsibilities<br />we have in our life,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:19.577\" end=\"00:17:22.994\" style=\"s2\">we have to spend the next few days<br />changing out the tags,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:22.994\" end=\"00:17:26.160\" style=\"s2\">experimenting with the title,<br />making a new thumbnail,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:26.160\" end=\"00:17:29.280\" style=\"s2\">bleeping the dialogue,<br />re-rendering, reuploading,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:29.280\" end=\"00:17:33.908\" style=\"s2\">over and over, trial and error–style,<br />until suddenly — ding!</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:33.908\" end=\"00:17:37.897\" style=\"s2\">Mysteriously, the ad-friendly light<br />changes from yellow to green.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:37.897\" end=\"00:17:39.725\" style=\"s2\">That is a baby’s toy,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:39.725\" end=\"00:17:43.497\" style=\"s2\">and it’s covering up for<br />experimental, failing technology.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:43.497\" end=\"00:17:45.954\" style=\"s2\">Google’s Vision API,<br />which is widely believed</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:45.954\" end=\"00:17:47.965\" style=\"s2\">to be the tool<br />that’s scanning thumbnails</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:47.965\" end=\"00:17:49.874\" style=\"s2\">to determine their<br />ad-friendliness or not,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:49.874\" end=\"00:17:53.240\" style=\"s2\">scans a thumbnail of PewDiePie,<br />and sees that as racy.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:53.240\" end=\"00:17:57.245\" style=\"s2\">Sees a picture of YouTube’s CEO,<br />Susan Wojcicki, as racy,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:17:57.245\" end=\"00:18:01.302\" style=\"s2\">and yet a photo of you-know-whos<br />in a you-know-what group,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:01.302\" end=\"00:18:03.090\" style=\"s2\">it thinks is perfectly fine.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:03.090\" end=\"00:18:05.485\" style=\"s2\">That gets a clean bill of health —<br />“Not Violent.”</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:05.485\" end=\"00:18:09.040\" style=\"s2\">And I can’t even say the name out loud<br />about what that is,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:09.040\" end=\"00:18:13.650\" style=\"s2\">because YouTube’s clumsy<br />closed caption–scanning bot</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:13.650\" end=\"00:18:16.262\" style=\"s2\">might think that I’m<br />talking about you-know-what.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:16.262\" end=\"00:18:18.377\" style=\"s2\">This technology is fascinating,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:18.377\" end=\"00:18:21.634\" style=\"s2\">but it’s also fascinatingly<br />bad at its job right now.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:21.634\" end=\"00:18:25.325\" style=\"s2\">If you’re gonna be pushing this through<br />as a live update running the site,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:25.325\"

obvious,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:30.422\" end=\"00:18:34.114\" style=\"s2\">but poor communication<br />and poorly performing machine learning</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:34.114\" end=\"00:18:36.902\" style=\"s2\">are creating important turning points<br />in people’s lives.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:36.902\" end=\"00:18:38.091\" style=\"s2\">after the adpocalypse,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:38.091\" end=\"00:18:40.354\" style=\"s2\">people who were trying<br />to make a living on YouTube</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:40.354\" end=\"00:18:42.948\" style=\"s2\">have had to branch out<br />into other sources of revenue</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:42.948\" end=\"00:18:44.102\" style=\"s2\">to pay their bills.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:44.102\" end=\"00:18:45.180\" style=\"s2\">You’re seeing

style=\"s2\">pushing their merch now.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:50.171\" end=\"00:18:51.862\" style=\"s2\">everyone’s into fashion all of a sudden.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:51.862\" end=\"00:18:54.754\" style=\"s2\">Diverse streams of revenue<br />are becoming a necessity.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:54.754\" end=\"00:18:58.857\" style=\"s2\">YouTube even knows this,<br />which is why they just acquired FameBit,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:18:58.857\" end=\"00:19:02.000\" style=\"s2\">which is a marketplace<br />that connects creators with advertisers.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:02.000\" end=\"00:19:05.177\" style=\"s2\">That tells me that we’re gonna be<br />seeing this even more than we already are.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:05.177\" end=\"00:19:06.571\" style=\"s2\">Witness me now!</p>\\n<p

begin=\"00:19:09.988\" end=\"00:19:12.731\" style=\"s2\">A few years ago,<br />if you were a mom-and-pop business,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:12.731\" end=\"00:19:14.720\" style=\"s2\">and you wanted<br />to put up a website for that business,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:14.720\" end=\"00:19:17.897\" style=\"s2\">you had to cobble together a bunch<br />of different skillsets to do that.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:17.897\" end=\"00:19:20.502\" style=\"s2\">You’d have to hire a web developer<br />to build the site,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:20.502\" end=\"00:19:24.285\" style=\"s2\">and then bug them to make changes for you<br />every time the site needed to be updated.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:24.285\" end=\"00:19:27.257\" style=\"s2\">not to mention the whole issue<br />of actually hosting the site,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:27.257\" end=\"00:19:29.154\" style=\"s2\">or buying the domain in the first place.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:29.154\" end=\"00:19:32.422\" style=\"s2\">Each of those things<br />requiring some know-how,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:32.422\" end=\"00:19:34.217\" style=\"s2\">or signing up for a different service.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:34.217\" end=\"00:19:36.114\" style=\"s2\">And then Squarespace came along,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:36.114\" end=\"00:19:37.542\" style=\"s2\">and you’ve probably<br />heard their name by now,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:37.542\" end=\"00:19:39.840\" style=\"s2\">because they actually did<br />something pretty valuable —</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:39.840\" end=\"00:19:42.537\" style=\"s2\">they took all of those things,<br />and they put them in one place.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:42.537\" end=\"00:19:44.045\" style=\"s2\">If you’re like most people I know,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:44.045\" end=\"00:19:46.742\" style=\"s2\">and you know absolutely nothing<br />about building a website,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:46.742\" end=\"00:19:48.240\" style=\"s2\">then that’s pretty useful,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:48.240\" end=\"00:19:50.422\" style=\"s2\">or even if you’re someone who does,<br />and you’re an expert,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:50.422\" end=\"00:19:52.297\" style=\"s2\">and you just want to<br />pop something up really easy.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:52.297\" end=\"00:19:53.977\" style=\"s2\">If you think that’s something you need,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:53.977\" end=\"00:19:56.057\" style=\"s2\">there is a coupon attached<br />to the link below,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:56.057\" end=\"00:19:58.217\" style=\"s2\">so you’d get 10% off your purchase.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:19:58.217\" end=\"00:20:02.114\" style=\"s2\">Plus, Squarespace will know that<br />we sent a potential customer their way,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:20:02.114\" end=\"00:20:04.148\" style=\"s2\">and hey maybe they’ll be back<br />to sponsor Nerd City.</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:20:04.148\" end=\"00:20:06.068\" style=\"s2\">Thanks for watching,<br />and subscribe if you’re new,</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:20:06.068\" end=\"00:20:07.394\" style=\"s2\">because I promise you</p>\\n<p begin=\"00:20:07.394\" end=\"00:20:11.085\" style=\"s2\">we are gonna get into something<br />much more entertaining next time.</p>\\n</div>\\n</body>\\n</tt>\\n'"

--> 00:03:50,140\\nso that’s something people recognized,\\n\\n75\\n00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,840\\nbut that was not really\\nthe underlying concern\\n\\n76\\n00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,100\\nabout the

00:04:04,914\\nabout demonetization.\\n\\n82\\n00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:07,222\\n-Are those things connected?\\n\\n83\\n00:04:07,222 --> 00:04:14,685\\n-So the the search and discovery systems\\nthat decide which videos to recommend,\\n\\n84\\n00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:18,480\\nthey don’t have any knowledge about\\nwhat’s going on in the advertising system,\\n\\n85\\n00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,948\\nso if you get that\\nyellow icon that you see\\n\\n86\\n00:04:20,948 --> 00:04:23,942\\nthat says it may not be\\nsuitable for all advertisers,\\n\\n87\\n00:04:23,942 -->

the truth.\\n\\n103\\n00:05:15,977 --> 00:05:17,737\\nHere’s what those two answers imply.\\n\\n104\\n00:05:17,737 --> 00:05:19,085\\nThe green or yellow status,\\n\\n105\\n00:05:19,085 -->

we’ll get into that in a second.\\n\\n191\\n00:09:16,914 --> 00:09:20,080\\nNone of I Hate Everything’s videos\\nwere served under the mature filter.\\n\\n192\\n00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,177\\nHe’s even said on Twitter that he thinks\\nthe bot is passing right over him.\\n\\n193\\n00:09:23,177 --> 00:09:24,180\\nBut why?\\n\\n194\\n00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,885\\nPossibly because he’s doing something\\nthat the other guys don’t.\\n\\n195\\n00:09:27,885 --> 00:09:31,931\\nI Hate Everything self-tags his videos\\nas satire when he uploads.\\n\\n196\\n00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:35,211\\nThe

PewDiePie and Idubbbz and ICE,\\n\\n203\\n00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:54,210\\nhave all had their catalogues of content\\nslammed by this mature rating,\\n\\n204\\n00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,200\\n-And I really want to talk about this,\\nbecause I’m pissed,\\n\\n205\\n00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,314\\nand I’m probably\\nmore pissed than I should be.\\n\\n206\\n00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:02,331\\n-They show

would they talk to their creators?\\n\\n213\\n00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,411\\nBetter communication about this\\nfrom YouTube\\n\\n214\\n00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:25,337\\ncould have saved those

content,\\nand that mature rating matters,\\n\\n217\\n00:10:32,057 --> 00:10:34,640\\nas Sealow, the lead researcher,\\nputs it here.\\n\\n218\\n00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,605\\n-Here are 10 videos from PewDiePie\\nthat were uploaded nine months ago.\\n\\n219\\n00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:41,005\\nTwo of these videos were rated mature.\\n\\n220\\n00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:45,417\\nOn average, reviews of a mature video\\nare 3.3 million views,\\n\\n221\\n00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:50,742\\nwhile the non-mature videos\\nhave an average of 6.65 million views.\\n\\n222\\n00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,200\\nThat is just over 50% less views\\nfor the mature videos.\\n\\n223\\n00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,537\\nThe community seem to agree\\nwith around 30%,\\n\\n224\\n00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:00,994\\nbut that is, of course, in the short term.\\n\\n225\\n00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,680\\nThese videos showcase\\nthe long-term effect,\\n\\n226\\n00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,508\\nbecause when it’s mature,\\nit won’t

showed,\\n\\n229\\n00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:15,794\\nthe impact is much bigger\\nfor smaller creators.\\n\\n230\\n00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:19,268\\nSo the second wave of this ad campaign\\nhunting for mature videos,\\n\\n231\\n00:11:19,268 --> 00:11:23,131\\nthis time targeted LGBTQ channels\\nand women’s issues channels.\\n\\n232\\n00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:26,502\\nThe list of confirmed M-rated videos\\ninclude Me Too videos\\n\\n233\\n00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:29,028\\nlike “My Story: Rape in College,”\\n\\n234\\n00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:30,480\\ncoming out videos like,\\n\\n235\\n00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,902\\n“Coming out (or not)\\nas a Gay Sri lankan Teen,”\\n\\n236\\n00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:37,314\\nand videos concerning gay rights issues\\nlike “Homosexuality in Chechnya,”\\n\\n237\\n00:11:37,314 --> 00:11:40,594\\nalso “Growing up illegally gay\\nFour life stories.”\\n\\n238\\n00:11:40,594 --> 00:11:43,485\\nthese are people who are\\nspeaking out about sexual abuse,\\n\\n239\\n00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:46,457\\nor against homophobia, being rated M.\\n\\n240\\n00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:50,217\\nThese voices, which I believe\\nthat YouTube leadership does care about,\\n\\n241\\n00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:53,280\\nare being suppressed\\nby this clumsy rating system.\\n\\n242\\n00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,600\\nso with that concerning pattern appearing,\\nthe last leg of the ad campaign\\n\\n243\\n00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,520\\ntargeted these keywords specifically.\\n\\n244\\n00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,594\\nThey placed ads on videos\\nrelated to coming out of the closet,\\n\\n245\\n00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:04,514\\nsuicide prevention, and Me Too.\\n\\n246\\n00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:07,954\\nthe videos that were rated mature\\nalong that keyword cloud\\n\\n247\\n00:12:07,954 --> 00:12:09,771\\nare heartbreaking to see.\\n\\n248\\n00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,022\\nThis is clearly where the results\\nare the most concerning,\\n\\n249\\n00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,240\\nbecause the bot can’t seem\\nto tell the difference\\n\\n250\\n00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,485\\nbetween a video that’s, let’s say,\\nmaking light of suicide,\\n\\n251\\n00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:20,800\\nand a video that’s aimed at\\ndissuading people who are suicidal\\n\\n252\\n00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,817\\nfrom going through with it.\\n\\n253\\n00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:23,851\\nLook at this video for example titled\\n\\n254\\n00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:27,154\\n“Before You Commit Suicide,\\nWatch This Video First.”\\n\\n255\\n00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:29,554\\nThe comments are filled\\nwith people sharing\\n\\n256\\n00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:31,108\\nhow much this video helped them.\\n\\n257\\n00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:34,422\\nSome people saying that watching it\\nliterally saved their life that day.\\n\\n258\\n00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:37,211\\nit was rated M, and made harder to find.\\n\\n259\\n00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:38,514\\nThat should not be happening.\\n\\n260\\n00:12:38,514 --> 00:12:42,708\\nif a young person\\nis considering hurting themselves,\\n\\n261\\n00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,291\\nthis might be\\nthe video they need to see.\\n\\n262\\n00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:49,817\\nThere should not be an age limit\\non encouraging people to choose life.\\n\\n263\\n00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:52,217\\nNext on the list, and similarly affected,\\n\\n264\\n00:12:52,217 --> 00:12:55,500\\nwe see first-person revelations\\nof sexual misconduct.\\n\\n265\\n00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,297\\nPart of the Me Too movement rated M.\\n\\n266\\n00:12:58,297 --> 00:13:02,730\\nThe recent openness about sharing\\nand listening to stories like this\\n\\n267\\n00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,771\\nwas an important cultural moment,\\nand censoring that directly undermines it.\\n\\n268\\n00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:10,914\\nthere’s evidence that\\ntagging “Metoo” in the metadata,\\n\\n269\\n00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:12,845\\nor putting Metoo in the title,\\n\\n270\\n00:13:12,845 --> 00:13:16,057\\nwhitelists it from\\nthe content rating system,\\n\\n271\\n00:13:16,057 --> 00:13:17,497\\nbut no one was told that.\\n\\n272\\n00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:18,880\\nThat’s not a clean solution\\n\\n273\\n00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,491\\nif the whitelist is just\\nquietly implemented by a programmer,\\n\\n274\\n00:13:22,491 --> 00:13:24,400\\nand never communicated to the community.\\n\\n275\\n00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,685\\nRegular people don’t have a crystal ball\\nabout what metadata to use for a video,\\n\\n276\\n00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:32,960\\nso not every video related to Me Too\\nused that hashtag,\\n\\n277\\n00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,514\\nand they won’t in the future,\\nnot if you don’t tell people.\\n\\n278\\n00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:38,308\\nYouTube is in a tough position.\\n\\n279\\n00:13:38,308 --> 00:13:40,388\\nWhatever they do,\\nthey’re gonna get slammed,\\n\\n280\\n00:13:40,388 --> 00:13:42,822\\nand on tricky topics, in lots of cases,\\n\\n281\\n00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,937\\ndepending who they side with\\ndetermines who’s gonna try to sue them.\\n\\n282\\n00:13:46,937 --> 00:13:50,160\\nOne theory I have for why YouTube\\nwill never be completely forthcoming\\n\\n283\\n00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,205\\nabout what their scanning bots can do\\n\\n284\\n00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:53,942\\nhas to do with U.S. copyright law.\\n\\n285\\n00:13:53,942 --> 00:13:57,177\\nIn order to benefit from\\nthe safe harbor provisions of the DMCA,\\n\\n286\\n00:13:57,177 --> 00:13:58,731\\nYouTube needs to be able to argue\\n\\n287\\n00:13:58,731 --> 00:14:01,440\\nthat they don’t have actual\\nor red-flagged knowledge\\n\\n288\\n00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,702\\nthat users are uploading\\ninfringing materials.\\n\\n289\\n00:14:03,702 --> 00:14:06,320\\nBut the better that\\nthis artificial intelligence gets,\\n\\n290\\n00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,297\\nthe better that the machine learning gets,\\n\\n291\\n00:14:08,297 --> 00:14:12,422\\nthe more they have to admit that, yeah,\\nthey can kind of tell what everything is\\n\\n292\\n00:14:12,422 --> 00:14:15,417\\nas soon as it’s uploaded,\\nand while it’s still being processed.\\n\\n293\\n00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:18,308\\nBut when you’re supporting\\nan ecosystem of creators\\n\\n294\\n00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:20,331\\nwho rely on this platform for a job,\\n\\n295\\n00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:23,280\\nwhich YouTube leadership\\nsay that they want you to do —\\n\\n296\\n00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,434\\n-So what we stand for\\nis really four freedoms.\\n\\n297\\n00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,611\\nfreedom of opportunity,\\nanybody to make a living on YouTube;\\n\\n298\\n00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:36,708\\nfreedom of speech, as important as ever;\\nfreedom of information, accessing it;\\n\\n299\\n00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:40,100\\nand then the fourth one\\nis freedom to belong.\\n\\n300\\n00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,045\\n-That puts an enormous responsibility\\nfor communication and fair play\\n\\n301\\n00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:45,382\\non the company’s back.\\n\\n302\\n00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:48,080\\nYouTube grew and grew and grew at any cost\\n\\n303\\n00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,274\\nin order to become\\nthe dominant video platform,\\n\\n304\\n00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:53,360\\nwhile the competition\\nwas crushed or faded away,\\n\\n305\\n00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,411\\nso they asked for this.\\nThey wanted this.\\n\\n306\\n00:14:56,411 --> 00:14:59,645\\nYouTube is the number two\\nmost visited site in the world,\\n\\n307\\n00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:01,988\\nsecond only\\nto the search engine that owns it.\\n\\n308\\n00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:04,331\\nThat’s the whole internet\\nbuilding around it.\\n\\n309\\n00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:06,720\\nThat is the world on its shoulders.\\n\\n310\\n00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,140\\nIn a year where the CEO of YouTube,\\nSusan Wojcicki, has promised\\n\\n311\\n00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:15,645\\nbetter communication and clearer policies,\\nthere are a lot of people, including me,\\n\\n312\\n00:15:15,645 --> 00:15:17,120\\ncounting on this to get better.\\n\\n313\\n00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,131\\nSo, solution: let’s have some clarity\\non this rating system.\\n\\n314\\n00:15:21,131 --> 00:15:24,765\\nWhat specifically triggers a rating\\non a video-to-video basis?\\n\\n315\\n00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:28,342\\nI know we’ve got some buffoons here,\\nbut trust your content creators\\n\\n316\\n00:15:28,342 --> 00:15:31,142\\nto build their content\\nto fit within those guidelines.\\n\\n317\\n00:15:31,142 --> 00:15:34,320\\nThey’ll adapt if they just\\nknow what they need to adapt.\\n\\n318\\n00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,760\\nWe’re already seeing that happening\\nas channels learn the hard way\\n\\n319\\n00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,708\\nand start trying to teach each other\\nwhat works/what doesn’t work.\\n\\n320\\n00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:44,948\\nHey, don’t upload puke videos,\\ndon’t put “gun” in the title,\\n\\n321\\n00:15:44,948 --> 00:15:49,794\\nuse use the satire tag,\\nuse the Metoo tag if that’s accurate.\\n\\n322\\n00:15:49,794 --> 00:15:53,954\\nThis information should be\\ncoming from YouTube, not Nerd City.\\n\\n323\\n00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,245\\nNot me, right?\\n\\n324\\n00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,828\\nNot independent Swedish researchers\\n\\n325\\n00:15:57,828 --> 00:16:00,274\\nwho have to poke the site\\nto see what it does.\\n\\n326\\n00:16:00,274 --> 00:16:03,130\\nWe’re trying to create things\\nthat will be entertaining,\\n\\n327\\n00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,005\\nand that will be seen by people,\\n\\n328\\n00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,190\\nbut the implementation\\nfor the rules on how to do that\\n\\n329\\n00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:12,045\\nchanges from day to day\\nand from week to week — secretly —\\n\\n330\\n00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:15,760\\nand it’s incredibly frustrating\\nto have to figure that out yourself\\n\\n331\\n00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,017\\nfrom trial and error,\\nor from other creators,\\n\\n332\\n00:16:19,017 --> 00:16:20,537\\nor from whistleblowers.\\n\\n333\\n00:16:20,537 --> 00:16:22,468\\nThe best documentation we have\\n\\n334\\n00:16:22,468 --> 00:16:25,120\\nfor understanding\\nwhat would trigger these ratings\\n\\n335\\n00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,308\\ncomes from a leak.\\n\\n336\\n00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:29,154\\nThanks to Tower Dog,\\nwhoever the fuck that is,\\n\\n337\\n00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,388\\nwe have a few pages of a document\\nthat was being used\\n\\n338\\n00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:35,782\\nby human manual reviewers\\nto look at YouTube videos,\\n\\n339\\n00:16:35,782 --> 00:16:37,428\\nbut the source was anonymous.\\n\\n340\\n00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:41,897\\nThis came out a few months ago\\nbefore the whole Logan Paul Japan debacle,\\n\\n341\\n00:16:41,897 --> 00:16:44,731\\nso the rules could’ve changed by now.\\nThey probably did.\\n\\n342\\n00:16:44,731 --> 00:16:47,245\\nWhy can’t we have\\nsomething like this on the up-and-up?\\n\\n343\\n00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:49,394\\nwhy can’t we get\\nsomething better than this?\\n\\n344\\n00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:54,651\\nSure, there are nice Q&A sessions\\non the creator insider channel now,\\n\\n345\\n00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:57,360\\nbut at the end of the day,\\nwe still have to upload a video,\\n\\n346\\n00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,457\\nand then get a result\\nwhich we interpret ourselves\\n\\n347\\n00:17:00,457 --> 00:17:02,788\\nbased off of an on or off switch.\\n\\n348\\n00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,114\\nNothing is more frustrating\\n\\n349\\n00:17:04,114 --> 00:17:07,245\\nthan spending days\\nor even weeks on a video,\\n\\n350\\n00:17:07,245 --> 00:17:09,942\\nuploading it,\\nhaving it pick up a mature rating\\n\\n351\\n00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:12,731\\nsecretly behind the scenes —\\nwe don’t know why —\\n\\n352\\n00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:16,114\\nand then instead of being able\\nto move on to the next creative process,\\n\\n353\\n00:17:16,114 --> 00:17:19,577\\nor let’s say take care of responsibilities\\nwe have in our life,\\n\\n354\\n00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:22,994\\nwe have to spend the next few days\\nchanging out the tags,\\n\\n355\\n00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:26,160\\nexperimenting with the title,\\nmaking a new thumbnail,\\n\\n356\\n00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,280\\nbleeping the dialogue,\\nre-rendering, reuploading,\\n\\n357\\n00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,908\\nover and over, trial and error–style,\\nuntil suddenly — ding!\\n\\n358\\n00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:37,897\\nMysteriously, the ad-friendly light\\nchanges from yellow to green.\\n\\n359\\n00:17:37,897 --> 00:17:39,725\\nThat is a baby’s toy,\\n\\n360\\n00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,497\\nand it’s covering up for\\nexperimental, failing technology.\\n\\n361\\n00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,954\\nGoogle’s Vision API,\\nwhich is widely believed\\n\\n362\\n00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:47,965\\nto be the

Violent.”\\n\\n369\\n00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:09,040\\nAnd I can’t even say the name out loud\\nabout what that is,\\n\\n370\\n00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,650\\nbecause YouTube’s clumsy\\nclosed

fascinating,\\n\\n373\\n00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:21,634\\nbut it’s also fascinatingly\\nbad at its job right now.\\n\\n374\\n00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:25,325\\nIf you’re gonna be pushing this through\\nas a live update running the site,\\n\\n375\\n00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:28,571\\nit’s got to be nearly perfect,\\nand it’s not even close.\\n\\n376\\n00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:30,422\\nThere’s money being wasted,\\nthat’s obvious,\\n\\n377\\n00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:34,114\\nbut poor communication\\nand poorly performing machine learning\\n\\n378\\n00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,902\\nare creating important turning points\\nin people’s lives.\\n\\n379\\n00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:38,091\\nafter the adpocalypse,\\n\\n380\\n00:18:38,091 --> 00:18:40,354\\npeople who were trying\\nto make a living on

00:18:45,180\\nYou’re seeing channels\\n\\n384\\n00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,262\\nthat normally wouldn’t otherwise\\ncare about selling t-shirts\\n\\n385\\n00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:50,171\\npushing their

connects creators with advertisers.\\n\\n390\\n00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,177\\nThat tells me that we’re gonna be\\nseeing this even more than we already are.\\n\\n391\\n00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,571\\nWitness me now!\\n\\n392\\n00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:07,794\\n-Witness me now!\\n\\n393\\n00:19:07,794 --> 00:19:09,988\\nI’m gonna tell you about Squarespace.\\n\\n394\\n00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:12,731\\nA few years ago,\\nif you were a mom-and-pop business,\\n\\n395\\n00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:14,720\\nand you wanted\\nto put up a website for that business,\\n\\n396\\n00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,897\\nyou had to cobble together a bunch\\nof different skillsets to do that.\\n\\n397\\n00:19:17,897 --> 00:19:20,502\\nYou’d have to hire a web developer\\nto build the site,\\n\\n398\\n00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:24,285\\nand then bug them to make changes for you\\nevery time the site needed to be updated.\\n\\n399\\n00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:27,257\\nnot to mention the whole issue\\nof actually hosting the site,\\n\\n400\\n00:19:27,257 --> 00:19:29,154\\nor buying the domain in the first place.\\n\\n401\\n00:19:29,154 --> 00:19:32,422\\nEach of those things\\nrequiring some know-how,\\n\\n402\\n00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,217\\nor signing up for a different service.\\n\\n403\\n00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:36,114\\nAnd then Squarespace came along,\\n\\n404\\n00:19:36,114 --> 00:19:37,542\\nand you’ve probably\\nheard their name by now,\\n\\n405\\n00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,840\\nbecause they actually did\\nsomething pretty valuable —\\n\\n406\\n00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,537\\nthey took all of those things,\\nand they put them in one place.\\n\\n407\\n00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:44,045\\nIf you’re like most people I know,\\n\\n408\\n00:19:44,045 --> 00:19:46,742\\nand you know absolutely nothing\\nabout building a website,\\n\\n409\\n00:19:46,742 --> 00:19:48,240\\nthen that’s pretty useful,\\n\\n410\\n00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,422\\nor even if you’re someone who does,\\nand you’re an expert,\\n\\n411\\n00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,297\\nand you just want to\\npop something up really easy.\\n\\n412\\n00:19:52,297 --> 00:19:53,977\\nIf you think that’s something you need,\\n\\n413\\n00:19:53,977 --> 00:19:56,057\\nthere is a coupon attached\\nto the link below,\\n\\n414\\n00:19:56,057 --> 00:19:58,217\\nso you’d get 10% off your purchase.\\n\\n415\\n00:19:58,217 --> 00:20:02,114\\nPlus, Squarespace will know that\\nwe sent a potential customer their way,\\n\\n416\\n00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:04,148\\nand hey maybe they’ll be back\\nto sponsor Nerd City.\\n\\n417\\n00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:06,068\\nThanks for watching,\\nand subscribe if you’re new,\\n\\n418\\n00:20:06,068 --> 00:20:07,394\\nbecause I promise you\\n\\n419\\n00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:11,085\\nwe are gonna get into something\\nmuch more entertaining next time.\\n\\n'"
